            Currently, I work at Shopify as a Senior Frontend Engineer crafting
            thoughtful and inclusive experiences that adhere to web standards
            for over 3 million merchants across the world.

            Before now, I was Principal Frontend Engineer at hellotax, where I
            worked on a suite of tools and services tailored towards automated
            VAT compliance for multi-channel sellers in Europe
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to hellotax, I was Senior frontend engineering consultant with
            Pixel2HTML, building JavaScript applications and interfaces for orgs
            and individuals.

            I once also led the frontend team at Conectar, an e-learning startup
            through building multiple React applications into a single robust
            learning platform.
